# jupyter-resources

Resources for using Jupyter notebooks and JupyterLab.

Rick Gilmore compiled these in teaching [PSY 525.001](https://psu-psychology.github.io/psy-525-reproducible-research-2020) in the Spring of 2020.

The [`psy-525-jupyter-notebooks.ipynb`](psy-525-jupyter-notebooks.ipynb) notebook is probably most relevant for students in PSY 525, and possibly for others.
